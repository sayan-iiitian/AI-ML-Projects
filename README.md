# 1)Here I have given the description for Tips_Dataset
I have made a small AIML project on TIPS_DATASET where by using SEABORN Library, 
I have  created a DataFrame of the whole data 
and made a small profile Report of the whole TIPS_DATASET 
where graphs of different types, SCATTER PLOT, SUB PLOT and many other things are present. 

# 2)Description about Medical Models
In this project, we made a smart computer program that can help predict three different health conditions: diabetes, heart disease, and Parkinson's disease. It's like having a virtual health detective! We taught the computer program to look at information about people, like their habits, test results, and how they move. Based on this information, the program can give an estimate if someone might get diabetes, have heart issues, or any other problems like Parkinson's disease. This can be really helpful for doctors to catch these issues early and give advice to keep people healthy."
